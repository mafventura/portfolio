                        This course was held for 12 weeks and involved morning standups then
                        proceeding with the classes which could vary from lectures, exercise labs
                        and deliverable <a href="#projects" class="text-blue underline">projects</a>.  With this course, I was able to advance my
                        programming knowledge and to build full-stack applications, with different
                        stacks of languages.
